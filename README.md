# GameDB

Welcome to my GameDB project! I will continue enhancing it, making it more visually appealing and functional as I improve my coding and web development skills.

In this project, I used the IGDB API to retrieve data on video games and set up a proxy with AWS to integrate the API into my website. There are many improvements I can make, and I am committed to enhancing every aspect of the project.
